Statement of impact : 

Traditional univariate methods are inacurate for lesion-behaviour
mapping. It is however unclear whether multivariate methods are
sufficient for this purpose.  Relying on causal inference
theory, we show that multivariate inference done with proper methods
achieves state-of-the art results.
